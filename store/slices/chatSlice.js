The crucial turning point was their victory over French forces at Wandiwash in 1760, leaving the English East India Company without a European rival. The British consolidated their power, engaging in conflicts with neighboring countries. This expansion began with their victory over Siraj-ud-daula at Plassey in 1757. The British continued to grow their influence in India and other aspects related to governance. In 1717, Mughal Emperor Farrukhsiyar granted significant privileges to the East India Company in Bengal, Gujarat, and Hyderabad via his farmans â€“ often referred to as the 'Magna Carta of the East India Company.' These events shaped British rule in India until it finally ended in 1947."
